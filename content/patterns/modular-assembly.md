# Modular Assembly

## Overview

Modular Assembly is an operating pattern where healthcare organizations build a library of reusable components, patterns, and design standards that local teams can combine to assemble solutions tailored to their specific needs, balancing standardization with flexibility.

## Key Principles

- **Composable components**: Services are built from interchangeable parts
- **Design standards**: Common patterns ensure consistency and usability
- **Local assembly**: Teams combine components to solve local needs
- **Shared dependency management**: Common components are maintained centrally
- **Progressive enhancement**: Basic capabilities are available to all; advanced customization for specialized needs

## Why This Pattern?

One-size-fits-all solutions don't work in healthcare's diverse environments, but building everything from scratch in each location creates waste and inconsistency. Modular Assembly lets teams build locally-optimized solutions using standardized components.

## Implementation Considerations

- Invest in identifying and building truly reusable components
- Create clear documentation and interfaces for components
- Establish governance for component versioning and updates
- Support teams in learning how to assemble solutions
- Build tools that make assembly easier
- Monitor component usage and retire unused components
