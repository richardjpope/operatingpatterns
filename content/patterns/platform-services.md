# Curation

## Overview

Curation is an operating pattern where disparate local services, capabilities, and solutions are discovered, evaluated, and presented in one unified interface or experience, creating consistency and ease of use despite underlying organizational complexity.

## Key Principles

- **Single point of access**: Users find what they need in one place
- **Quality filtering**: Services are curated to ensure they meet standards
- **Unified experience**: Consistent interface across diverse underlying services
- **Local autonomy preserved**: Individual departments retain control of their services
- **Smart discovery**: Services are tagged, categorized, and searchable

## Why This Pattern?

Healthcare organizations often have a confusing array of local services, tools, and capabilities. Users don't know where to look, leading to duplication, workarounds, and frustration. Curation creates clarity and usability without requiring everything to be built centrally.

## Implementation Considerations

- Build a comprehensive catalog of available services
- Establish clear criteria for inclusion and quality standards
- Invest in search and discovery capabilities
- Create an experience layer that doesn't change underlying services
- Regularly audit and retire services that aren't valuable
