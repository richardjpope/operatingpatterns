# Local Innovation, Scaled

## Overview

Local Innovation, Scaled is an operating pattern where solutions developed by one department or location to solve a local problem are refined, generalized, and made available to other parts of the organization, multiplying the value of innovation.

## Key Principles

- **Bottom-up innovation**: Solutions emerge from frontline teams solving real problems
- **Proof of concept**: Local success demonstrates viability before scaling
- **Generalization**: Local solutions are adapted to work in different contexts
- **Knowledge transfer**: The team that developed the solution helps others implement it
- **Continued ownership**: Local innovators maintain connection to the scaled solution

## Why This Pattern?

Innovation often emerges from frontline staff solving local problems. Rather than having all innovation top-down or centralized, organizations can encourage local problem-solving and then scale the best solutions organization-wide.

## Implementation Considerations

- Create channels for frontline innovations to be identified and escalated
- Establish clear criteria for determining which innovations merit scaling
- Invest in knowledge transfer and documentation
- Provide support for implementation in new contexts
- Recognize and reward local innovators
- Plan for adaptation to local context, not one-size-fits-all implementation
