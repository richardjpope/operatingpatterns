# Regional Cancer Center Model

## Context

A 5-hospital health system wanted to create a destination cancer program while maintaining local service delivery in smaller markets.

## Pattern Applied

[Service Line Autonomy](/patterns/service-line-autonomy/) - The cancer center operates with significant autonomy over clinical protocols, treatment options, and staffing while maintaining alignment with the system's quality and financial targets.

## Implementation

- **Governance**: Cancer center director reports directly to COO with quarterly strategic reviews
- **Staffing**: Local decision-making on medical staff credentialing and hiring
- **Operations**: Daily operational decisions made locally; major capital and strategy decisions reviewed at system level
- **Revenue Model**: Service line P&L accountability with shared savings on certain network services

## Results

- 40% increase in tertiary cancer referrals within 18 months
- 15% improvement in operational margin despite increased staffing investment
- 92% physician satisfaction with autonomy model
- Reduced decision cycle time from 6 weeks to 3 weeks

## Lessons Learned

- Clear financial metrics and accountability are essential
- Regular communication prevents "drift" between center and system strategy
- Shared governance forums help other service lines learn from the cancer center's innovations
