# Enterprise Finance Center of Excellence

## Context

A 10-hospital system was struggling with:
- Inconsistent financial reporting across hospitals
- High cost of finance operations (8% of revenue)
- Slow close process (15 days)
- Limited analytical capability for operational decisions

## Pattern Applied

[Shared Services Model](/patterns/shared-services/) - Consolidated all finance transactional and analytical work into three regional centers of excellence.

## Implementation

- **Transactional Hub**: All accounts payable, general accounting, and payroll processed centrally
- **Analytical Center**: 8 FTEs dedicated to operational analysis and insights for each service line
- **Compliance Center**: Revenue cycle and compliance specialists ensuring accuracy
- **Technology**: Implemented cloud-based ERP with standardized chart of accounts

## Results

- Finance costs reduced from 8% to 6.2% of revenue
- Financial close time reduced to 5 days
- Service line finance leaders shifted from transaction oversight to strategic planning
- Enabled new analytics capabilities (real-time dashboards)

## Lessons Learned

- Clear SLAs and governance prevent COE from becoming bottleneck
- Requires significant change management and training
- Need for clinical finance liaisons to translate between operational and finance teams
